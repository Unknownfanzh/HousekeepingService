## Objective:

This app allows housekeeping service providers to post their services to connect them to people seeking housekeeping. The app provides a platform for both service providers and consumers. The app implements a basic signing up system, and provides users with the choice to see services to book or to post appointments. Posting a service connects to a database that lets other users see it in the booking area. Finally, users can provide ratings to appointments based on their experience.
